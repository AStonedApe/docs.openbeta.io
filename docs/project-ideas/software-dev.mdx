### FA Data Cleanup
- **Skills required:** Python
- **Mentor:** Viet Nguyen
- **Expected Size:** 175h
- **Level of Difficulty:** Medium
- **Expected Outcome:** A new dataset in which each record contains a list of names and date/year associated with a climb ID. When encountered parsing errors or missing information, set the error attribute to true.
- **What you will learn:** Apply Python and possibly machine learning libraries to clean up data. You will also learn how to work collaboratively with other developers and stakeholders to solve a real world problem.

[First ascenionists](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_ascent) (FA) played a vital role in the development of rock climbing.  Unfortunately records of notable first ascents and modern climb area development are scattered in printed guidebooks (some are out-of-print), or on defunct websites.

This project involves processing and cleaning up the FA text field in a JSON dataset with approximately 205K records of climbing routes established in the USA.  The text field contains a CSV list of individual names and the year they established the climb.  

There are several exceptions and inconsistencies in the CSV format.  For example, the commas are not always used to separate names (the word '*and*' is used instead).  Additionally the spelling of names are not always consistent. Ex: *J Doe* and *Jane Doe* are in fact referring to the same individual.  See more [examples](https://github.com/OpenBeta/fa-cleanup).

The successful contributor will need to have an intermediate level of Python as well as an understanding of data cleansing.

### FA Name Verification Tool
- **Skills required:** Javascript
- **Mentor:** Viet Nguyen
- **Expected Size:** 175h or 350h
- **Level of Difficulty:** Medium
- **Expected Outcome:** A new web tool added to our frontend app to enable users to add missing FA names or fix erroneous entries flagged by the the FA Data Cleanup project.
- **What you will learn:**  How to build a modern UI tool in React to help users add/edit data coming from a database.  You will also learn how to work collaboratively with other developers to solve a real world problem.

See **[FA Data Cleanup](#fa-data-cleanup)** project above for context.

This project involves creating a web tool to enable openbeta.io users to browse the list of climbing routes with First Ascenionists data flagged for manual verification.  A user can provide missing names or make corrections and save changes.  The tool should be an integral part of our frontend NextJS application.

The successful contributor will need to have an intermediate level of React, CSS, and GraphQL.  If you have full stack experience, we can extend the project to 350 hours to give you the opportunity to work on building both the backend API and frontend UI.

### OpenStreetMap Cliff Import
