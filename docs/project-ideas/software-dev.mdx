### FA Data Cleanup
- Skills required: Python
- Mentor: Viet Nguyen
- Expected Size: 175h
- Level of Difficulty: Medium
- Expected Outcome: Generate a new dataset containing a list of name and date/year associated with a climb ID. Flag errors for incomplete entries.

[First ascenionists](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_ascent) played a vital role in the development of rock climbing.  Unfortunately information about historical first ascents and modern development are scattered in printed guidebooks (some are out of print), or defunct websites.

This project involves processing and cleaning up a text field in a dataset of approximately 205K records of climbing routes established in the USA.  The FA field contains a CSV list of individual names and the year they established the climb.  

There are several exceptions and inconsistencies in the CSV format.  For example, the commas are not always used to separate names (the word 'and' is used instead).  Additionally the spelling of names are not always consistent. Ex: J Doe and Jane Doe are in fact referring to the same individual.

The successful contributor will need an intermediate level of Python, as well as an understanding of data cleansing and  additional Python modules.
