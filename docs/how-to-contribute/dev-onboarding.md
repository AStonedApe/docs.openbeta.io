## New Devs

- [ ] We also recommend watching [this one](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uszj_k0DGsg) to understand how fork, branch and pull requests work.

Please make sure you understand the following:
- [ ] GitHub: be able to fork a repo and submit a pull-request
- [ ] GitHub: be able to rebase your branch with remote

Now you have learned the basics, let's get our hands dirty!

1. Fork [docs.openbeta.io repo](https://github.com/OpenBeta/docs.openbeta.io/tree/develop)
2. Clone it to your local machine. `git clone url-of-your-forked-repo`
3. Open it with your favorite code editor, and create a new branch. Lets's call it `add-yun`(replace yun with your name).
4. Go to `all-contributors.md` file, answer the questions in there. save the file.
5. Go to your terminal, commit the changes you just made. Write a meaningful commit message, could be "add Yun's response to all contributors file".
6. Push your branch to the remote repo with `git push --set-upstream add-yun`.
7. Go to the forked repo GitHub page, here you should see a `Compare & Pull request` reminder from GitHub, click on the big green button to create a pull request. Here you could choose where you want to compare it to, choose our original repo and create a pr. 
8. Once you have submit your PR, assign one of your maintainers to review it.
