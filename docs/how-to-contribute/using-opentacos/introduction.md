Welcome to OpenTacos! ðŸ¥³ðŸ¥³ðŸ¥³

If you're here we assume you've already [visited the site](https://openbeta.io) and had a chance to click around, and are here to get help on using one of the tools bundled in OpenTacos

## What is OpenTacos

[OpenTacos](https://github.com/openbeta/opentacos) is our mystically-named website that provides users with a way to work with the climbing dataset in their day to day climbing adventures.

While the history of the name may be a little hazy, the purpose of the site is clearly defined. A platform and tool-set that reduces friction as much as possible for users who are minded to help maintain the OpenBeta climbing data. 

### Home Page

The [home page](https://openbeta.io) of OpenTacos is a dynamic place, and will be changing constantly over the next few development cycles (If you want to be a part of shaping it, visit our [github](https://github.com/OpenBeta)).

Don't let this scare you! The home page will always put you a few clicks from maps, recent posts, and recent edit history.

### Climb Page

The climb page documents all-things climbing. This is where you can see all images tagged with a climb, as well as all recorded beta.

#### Ticks

##### How to import ticks from [Mountain Project](https://mountainproject.com)

### Crag / Boulder Page

### Area Page

### [Profile](/how-to-contribute/contribute-data/using-opentacos/profile)
If you are logged in to OpenTacos, you will see a profile button in the top right. This is where you will manage things related to your profile

### Create an Account

In order to make data contributions to OpenBeta, users are required to be authenticated. All you need is an email address, and you can get going! ðŸ“­

### Maps

Maps are a critical and currently growing part of the OpenBeta service offering. Weather you're navigating or simple exploring an area, maps are a critical part of the process.

OpenBeta makes use of a heatmap to express climb density, with hotspots representing areas that have a high density of climbs.

## How can I contribute to OpenTacos
