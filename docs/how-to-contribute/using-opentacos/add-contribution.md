# How to Add an Area to OpenBeta

First, ensure that you are [logged in](./introduction#create-an-account) to [OpenBeta](https://openbeta.io). On the home page, you will see an 'edit' tab. Navigate to it, and you will be presented with a global history for the OpenBeta dataset.

Click on **Add Area**, to get started with your addition.

![step one](/img/tutorial/opentacos/add-area-step-1.png)

The first thing to do when adding an Area, is to assign it a parent. The question being answered here is

> "Where is this area?"

The area we are adding in this example is [Rocklands](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rocklands,_South_Africa) which is in [Clanwilliam, Cederberg](https://www.cederberg.com/), from the country [South Africa](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Africa).

We know that it is in the cederberg wilderness area South Africa, so we search for that area and select the correct entry

The next field is **"Reference Climbing area"**. This field is intended to link a nearby climbing area (a sibling) that will tell OpenBeta what parent to assign this new area. As we are adding a very big climbing area, it has no nearby other areas yet, so in this example we will leave this blank.

We fill in the **Area Name** as "Rocklands", and we're ready to proceed to the submission step.

![step 3](/img/tutorial/opentacos/add-area-step-3.png)

After clicking "Add Area", we will be presented with a success message

![step 4](/img/tutorial/opentacos/add-area-step-4.png)

If you click "View Area" you will be taken to your newly created area.

## Next steps

Hooray ðŸŽ‰ You've added your area(s). The next thing to check out is how to [Give that area some climbs](#how-to-add-a-climb-to-openbeta) and [How to edit areas](./edit#how-to-edit-areas). You could also keep reading and take a look at [Add a child Area to an existing Area](#add-a-child-area-sub-area-to-an-existing-area)

## Add a child Area (sub-Area) to an existing Area

In the walkthrough above, the first few steps are to do with defining **where** this area belongs. You can skip these steps by navigating to the area view and clicking `Edit`, then `Add new Area`

![step 1](/img/tutorial/opentacos/add-child-area-step-1.png)

You can see that this drastically simplifies the process of adding areas. Simply enter the name of the new area, and it will be added as a sub-area (child) to the one we were viewing.
