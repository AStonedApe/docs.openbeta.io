Making edits to existing entities is an imortant process for all contributors. Information submitted at time of creation can be rushed or incomplete - which is fine! it's always difficult to account for everything in one go - as a result we need to make edits when we see errors / missing information.

## How to edit Areas ðŸ–Š

You may see an `edit` button for areas in a number of places. But the clearest way to go about it is to search for an area, or navigate to it from a nearby one. In our example, we're going to navigate to the [Mazama](https://openbeta.io/areas/adf24468-f935-56e6-b9d0-6d6f1d11318e) area in [Okanogan, Washington](https://openbeta.io/areas/5e4fa564-9237-5108-9402-4ac129e2d9e9)

If you're [logged in](./introduction#create-an-account), you'll see an `Edit` button for this area.

![step 1](/img/tutorial/opentacos/edit-area-step-1.png)

Go ahead and expand the edit menu, and take a look at the available options.

![step 2](/img/tutorial/opentacos/edit-area-step-2.png)

Here we see

1. **Edit** - This will take us to the edit window and allow us to make changes to the data on this area
1. **Add new area** - This is the easiest way to [add child areas](./add-contribution#how-to-add-an-area-to-openbeta).
1. **Delete this area** - This is greyed out because deletion of areas with climbs still in them is prohibited

We'll click "Edit", and take a look at the edit window.

![step 3](/img/tutorial/opentacos/edit-area-step-3.png)

Here we can modify existing fields and make additions where we need to. Make the changes that you came to make, and hit `Save` to commit those changes.

![step 4](/img/tutorial/opentacos/edit-area-step-4.png)

We're done! ðŸŽ‰ðŸŽ‰ðŸŽ‰ If you head over to the [global history page](https://openbeta.io/edit) you can see that our changes appear in the global history
