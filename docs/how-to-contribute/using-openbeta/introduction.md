Welcome to OpenBeta! ðŸ¥³ðŸ¥³ðŸ¥³

If you're here we assume you've already [visited the site](https://openbeta.io) and had a chance to click around, and are here to get help on using one of the tools bundled in OpenBeta

## What is OpenBeta

[OpenBeta Climb Catalog](https://github.com/openbeta/open-tacos) is our website dedicated to providing users with a seamless experience while working with the climbing dataset during their climbing adventures.

The purpose of OpenBeta is to serve as a platform and toolset that minimizes friction for users interested in contributing to the maintenance of the OpenBeta climbing data. It offers a convenient way to access and utilize the climbing dataset, making it easier for climbers to engage with and contribute to the OpenBeta community.

### Home Page

![Homepage](/img/tutorial/opentacos/homepage.png)

The [home page](https://openbeta.io) of OpenBeta is a dynamic place, and will be changing constantly over the next few development cycles (If you want to be a part of shaping it, visit our [github](https://github.com/OpenBeta)).

Don't let this scare you! The home page will always put you a few clicks from maps, recent posts, and recent edit history.

### Climb Page

![Climbing Page screenshot](/img/tutorial/opentacos/climb-page.png)

The climb page documents all-things climbing. This is where you can see all images tagged with a climb, as well as all recorded beta.

#### Ticks

Ticks allow users to log and track the climbs that they have completed. Ticks serve a number of practical purposes ([See more about ticks here](/how-to-contribute/contributing-data/user-related#ticks))

##### How to import ticks from [Mountain Project](https://mountainproject.com)

### Crag / Boulder Page

### Area Page

![area page](/img/tutorial/opentacos/area-page.png)

The area page allows you to browse the climb/crag hierarchy and see where data has been sorted. Areas also collate media from their children, which can be useful while navigating or sizing up a crag or boulder.

### [Profile](/how-to-contribute/using-openbeta/profile-and-photos)

If you are logged in to OpenBeta, you will see a profile button in the top right. This is where you will manage things related to your profile ([click here to see more about the profile page](/how-to-contribute/using-openbeta/profile-and-photos))

### Create an Account

In order to make data contributions to OpenBeta, users are required to be authenticated. All you need is an email address, and you can get going! ðŸ“­

Go to the [home page](https://openbeta.io) and click the **become a contributor** button in the top right corner.

### Maps

Maps are a critical and currently growing part of the OpenBeta service offering. Whether you're navigating or simple exploring an area, maps are an invaluable part of the process.

OpenBeta makes use of a heatmap to express climb density, with hotspots representing areas that have a high density of climbs (as can be seen in the below image)

## How can I contribute to OpenBeta

"Contributors" on OpenBeta are the people who help to maintain and grow the OpenBeta dataset. To join this effort all you need is [an account](#create-an-account)

There are a number of ways you can join the effort, some of them are listed below.

### Become a Contributor

Even if all you do is upload some photos and correct some spelling, being a contributor on OpenBeta will improve the dataset for future climbers.

### Join the Team

If you want, you can go beyond working with the tools provided by OpenBeta. This could be to **work on the tools themselves** or to assist the developers that are.

The OpenBeta team usually communicates on [discord](https://discord.gg/RFufzsqRmJ) and catalogue issues with [GitHub](https://github.com/openbeta/open-tacos)

#### Become a Developer

Follow the [onboarding process](../dev-onboarding.md) and start contributing code to the OpenBeta projects! ðŸ–¥

#### Contribute in other parts of development

If you are not a developer - but still want to assist with development - fear not! You could [become a sponsor](/support-us), but you needn't stop there. Our developers often need help finding and reporting bugs, you can report bugs either as an [issue on the repository](https://github.com/openbeta/open-tacos/issues) or by reporting it in the [discord server](https://discord.gg/RFufzsqRmJ).

We look forward to working with you!
