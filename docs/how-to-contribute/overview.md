🎉 **First off, thanks for taking the time to contribute!** 👍

OpenBeta is a climber-led, all-volunteer effort. You don't have to code to get involved. We listed four levels of contribution based on your availability and commitment. Choose the level that best fits your preferences and make a meaningful impact on the future of open source + rock climbing.

:::info Code of Conduct
This project and everyone participating in it is governed by the [OpenBeta Code of Conduct](./code-of-conduct). By participating, you are expected to uphold this code.

### Level 0️⃣ { Warmups } Start using [openbeta.io](https://openbeta.io/)
⌛: < 1 hr/week

🔨: none

If you have limited time but still want to contribute, you can help by simply starting to use OpenBeta, our climbing catalog.

Here's a list of things you can do to help:  

- Use [OpenBeta](https://openbeta.io/) to find climbing information.
- If you can't find what you are looking for, create an account to add a route or two.
- Follow our social media accounts([Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/openbetaproject/)), and tag us when you post something about OpenBeta.
- Join our [Discord](https://discord.com/invite/ptpnWWNkJx) community. Tell us about yourself, how you like and dislike OpenBeta, and what you want to see in the future. 
### Level 1️⃣ { Onsights } Quick contributions
If you have a bit more time, you can have a quick contribution in two fields:

#### 1. No Code
⌛: < 3 hrs/week

🔨: none

You can contribute to data maintenance and growth. This is critical to the long term viability of the project, and also where we need the largest number of contributors. 

Since OpenBeta is a community based platform, we reply on climbers to use it in their day to day adventures, and to make edits and additions when they see something wrong or missing.

Visit [Using OpenBeta](/how-to-contribute/using-openbeta/introduction) to learn more about how to contribute data to the platform.

#### 2. Code 
⌛: < 3 hrs/week

1. Pick up an issue: Browse through the list of open issues and find one that matches your skills and interests. 
2. Leave a comment expressing your intent to work on it to avoid duplication of effort.
3. Work on the issue once you are assinged to it.
