OpenBeta is a climber-led, all-volunteer effort. You can help us with just a one-off task or join the core volunteer team and participate in long term projects.

:::note
The following is a set of guidelines for contributing to OpenBeta projects, which are hosted in the [OpenBeta Organization](https://github.com/orgs/OpenBeta/) on GitHub. These are mostly guidelines, not rules. Use your best judgment, and feel free to propose changes to this document in a pull request.

### Code of Conduct

This project and everyone participating in it is governed by the [OpenBeta of Conduct](./code-of-conduct). By participating, you are expected to uphold this code.


## How can I contribute?

### Software development

We're looking for help with frontend, backend, and full stack development.  OpenBeta is a [greenfield project](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greenfield_project) with few constrains and without ten thousand legacy code.

**Our tech stack:** JavaScript/TypeScript, HTML, CSS, Tailwindcss, Node.js, MongoDB, Docker and Kubernetes.

We follow the common GitHub pull-request and merge workflow.  

:::note
For new contributors, we ask that you fork the repo you will be working on, and submit pull requests from your fork.  We invite frequent contributors to join the core dev team with write permission to simplify your workflow.
