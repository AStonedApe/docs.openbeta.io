üéâ **First off, thanks for taking the time to contribute!** üëç

OpenBeta is a climber-led, all-volunteer effort. You can get involved with just a one-off task or join the core volunteer team and participate in longer term projects.

We're building a new climbing platform from the ground up, which means fewer constrains and without ten thousand lines of legacy code.  You can make a direct impact on the future of open source + rock climbing.

## Code of Conduct

This project and everyone participating in it is governed by the [OpenBeta of Conduct](./code-of-conduct). By participating, you are expected to uphold this code.


## How can I contribute?

We want contributing to the project be fun and educational.  Here's a non-exhaustive list of areas we're needing help with:

### Data Science & Data Engineering

We're looking help to parse and organize FA information.  We're also looking for help to improve search indices for the [Climb search API](https://openbeta.substack.com/p/announcing-free-access-climb-search-api).

**Review the [onboarding checklist](./onboarding-checklist).**


### Software Development

We're looking for help with frontend, backend, and full stack development.

**Our tech stack:** JavaScript (TypeScript), HTML, CSS, TailwindCSS, Node.js, GraphQL, Python, Pandas, MongoDB, Docker and Kubernetes.

We follow the standard GitHub pull-request and merge process.
