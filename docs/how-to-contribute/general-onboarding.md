# Step 3 Organization Workflow
Our workflow involves both unsynchronized communications through GitHub issues, pull requests (PRs), and a Discord channel, as well as regular synchronized meetings. Here's an overview of our organization workflow:

## Unsynchronized Communication

### GitHub Issues:

- Use GitHub issues to report bugs, suggest features, or discuss project-related topics.
- If you'd like to work on the issue, assign yourself.
- If you are unsure about how to start, you could @ our core dev team members(list here). Alternatively, you could post in our discord channel to get help.

### Pull Requests (PRs):

- Once you know how to start working on the issue, you could fork the project repository and create a branch for your changes. 
- Submit PRs to propose changes, bug fixes, or new features.
- Request reviews from our core dev team members, engage in PR discussions, respond to feedback, and iterate on the changes based on reviewer comments.

### Discord Channel:

- Join our Discord channel to connect with the community and engage in real-time discussions.
- If you are stuck, this is a good place to seek help, ask questions, and share ideas or insights related to the project.
- Coordinate efforts, gather feedback, and collaborate with other contributors.


## Synchronized Meetings
We meet bi-weekly to synchronize efforts and provide updates on the project's progress. Check out the current project we are working on and join the meeting if you are interested.

# Step 4: Approval Process
1. GitHub Issues: 

- Everyone can open an issue and assign themselves to the issue.
- If you'd like to work on an existing issue, please comment and make sure that no one is working on it to avoid duplicated effort.
- We recommend you discuss the solutions you have in mind before you start working on it. If you don't know where to start, you should ask for help. Please refer to the organization workflow to start a conversation. 

2. Pull Requests:

- You could assign our core dev team members to review your PR.
- During the review process, you might get some feedback and suggestions. 

3. Approval and Merging
Once your changes have been reviewed and you've incorporated the feedback, one of our project maintainers will merge your PR. (@vnugent  not sure if this is the workflow we have now, please advise)
