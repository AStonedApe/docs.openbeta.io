OpenBeta is possible thanks to the support of the community.  We are creating and maintaining open source tools to make volumes of crowd-sourced climbing information, created and shared by climbers, 
continue to be accessible as a public resource.

### How can you help?

OpenBeta is not backed by venture capitalists, nor it is supported by ads. Fortunately
 there is a small but dedicated group of volunteers donating their time and expertise to keep the project running and develop it further.

For the project to survive and continue to evolve, we need your financial support and ask for your donation today. All money donated will go directly to fund server rentals and software subscription expenses.

- [Make a one time donation](https://opencollective.com/openbeta/donate)
- [Become a sustaining backer](https://opencollective.com/openbeta/contribute/backer-31664/checkout) for as little as $3/month.

*OpenBeta is a 501(c)(3) nonprofit collective under the Open Collective Foundation.  All donations are tax-deductible where applicable.*
