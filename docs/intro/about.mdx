# Introduction

OpenBeta is an open source project that enables **new** and **innovative** uses of data about rock climbing routes.

### What We Do

- Publish rock climbing datasets, volumes of crowd-sourced climbing information, created and shared by climbers, under an **open license**.
- Develop and maintain open source tools to enable the community to work with the climbing data.
