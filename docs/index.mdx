# Introduction

OpenBeta is an open source project that enables **new** and **innovative** uses of data about rock climbing routes.

## What We Do

- Publish rock climbing datasets under an open license.
- Develop and maintain open source tools to make volumes of crowd-sourced climbing information, created and shared by climbers, continue to be accessible as a public resource.
