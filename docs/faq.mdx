### Licensing
<details>
  <summary><h4>What is an open license?</h4></summary>
  <p>Broadly speaking, an open license is one which grants permission to access, re-use and redistribute a work with few or no restrictions.  [Source: <a href='https://opendefinition.org/guide/'>The Open Knowledge Foundation.</a>]</p>

<details>
  <summary><h4>Under what license is your climbing content published?</h4></summary>
  <p>Excluding photos and software source code, OpenBeta climbing content ("data") is published under the <a href='https://creativecommons.org/share-your-work/public-domain/cc0/'><b>Creative Commons Public Domain (aka CC0).</b></a></p>
</details>

<details>
  <summary><h4>Why does climbing content need a license where I can already browse climbing sites for free.</h4></summary>
  <p>While other climbing websites don't charge a fee to read their content, that is where your rights stop.  You may or may not allow to copy and share the information with others.  To understand what you can and cannot do with the information on a site, you need to parse their Terms & Conditions.</p>
  <p>An open license allows others to continuously improve and build on your work.</p>
