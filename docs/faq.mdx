### Licensing
<details>
  <summary><h4>What is an open license?</h4></summary>
  <p>Broadly speaking, an open license is one which grants permission to access, re-use and redistribute a work with few or no restrictions.  [Source: <a href='https://opendefinition.org/guide/'>The Open Knowledge Foundation.</a>]</p>
</details>

<details>
  <summary><h4>Under what license is your climbing data published?</h4></summary>
  <p>Excluding photos and software source code, OpenBeta climbing data is published under the <a href='https://creativecommons.org/share-your-work/public-domain/cc0/'><b>Creative Commons Public Domain (aka CC0).</b></a></p>
</details>

<details>
  <summary><h4>Why do you publish the climbing data under CC0?</h4></summary>
  <p>We choose <a href='https://creativecommons.org/share-your-work/public-domain/cc0/'><b>CC0</b></a> to maximize reuse and adoption.</p><p>Crowd-sourced climbing data is the labor of the climbing community.  Oftentimes it's the work of multiple contributors and a mix of creative, and factual and non-copyritable content.  Figuring out authorship and where copyrightable content begins and ends can be a technical and legal nightmare for the community.  CC0 removes the legal red tape burden from community members who want to reuse and add value to the existing work.</p>
</details>

<details>
  <summary><h4>Why does climbing content need a license where I can already browse climbing sites for free.</h4></summary>
  <p>While other climbing websites don't charge a fee to read their content, that is where your rights stop.  You may or may not allow to copy and share the information with others.  To understand what you can and cannot do with the information on a site, you need to parse their Terms & Conditions.</p>
  <p>By applying a well-known and open license (such as those by the Creative Commons) to your data, you remove ambiguity and allow others to improve and build on your work.</p>
