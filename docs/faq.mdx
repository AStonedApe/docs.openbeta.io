### Licensing
<details>
  <summary><h4>What is an open license?</h4></summary>
  <p>Broadly speaking, an open license is one which grants permission to access, re-use and redistribute a work with few or no restrictions.  [Source: <a href='https://opendefinition.org/guide/'>The Open Knowledge Foundation.</a>]</p>
</details>

<details>
  <summary><h4>Under what license is your climbing data published?</h4></summary>
  <p>Excluding photos and software source code, OpenBeta climbing data is published under the <a href='https://creativecommons.org/share-your-work/public-domain/cc0/'><b>Creative Commons Public Domain (aka CC0).</b></a></p>
</details>

<details>
  <summary><h4>Why do you publish the climbing data under CC0?</h4></summary>
  <p>We choose <a href='https://creativecommons.org/share-your-work/public-domain/cc0/'><b>CC0</b></a> to maximize reuse and adoption.</p><p><b>Long answer:</b> Crowd-sourced climbing data is the labor of the climbing community.  Oftentimes it's the work of multiple contributors and a mix of creative, and factual and non-copyritable content.  Figuring out authorship and where copyrightable content begins and ends can be a technical and legal nightmare for the community.  CC0 removes the legal red tape burden from community members who want to reuse and add value to the existing work.</p>
</details>

<details>
  <summary><h4>Why does climbing content need a license where I can already browse climbing sites for free?</h4></summary>
  <p>While other climbing websites don't charge a fee to read the content, that is where your rights stop.  Their Terms and Conditions may forbid you from copying and reusing the crowd-sourced information even if the information may not be copyrightable.</p>

  <p>By adopting a well-known and open license (such as those by the Creative Commons), you remove ambiguity and allow community members to improve and build on your work.</p>
